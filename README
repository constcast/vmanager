Subdirectories:
===========================

/controller: Python program that controls a running instance of Vermont
/manager: Central instance of managing system that controls several Vermont instances
/webinterface: Webinterface for Apache mod_python that manages multiple Vermont instances and uses helper application in /manager

Requirements:
===========================
* Required packages/libraries for all applications:
   - python-4suite-xml
   - python-pydot
   - graphviz (for program dot)
   - rrdtool
* Required packages/libraries for webinterface:
   - apache2
   - libapach2-mod-python
   - python-cheetah


How to install/run applications:
======================================
* call ./build_target.sh (will create subdirectory 'target' with all applications and needed files)
* Controller:
   - go to application directory (target/controller)
   - edit vermontcontroller.conf
   - run 'python VermontController.py vermontcontroller.conf
* Manager:
   - go to application directory (target/manager)
   - edit vm.conf
   - run 'python VermontManager.py vm.conf'
* Webinterface:
   - install apache
   - configure apache, use sample configuration as template (target/webinterface/apache-config.sample)
      - ATTENTION: sample configuration only uses basic authentication mechanisms and DOES NOT restrict access to web application to subnets, this may need to be changed
      - all values inside @@..@@ need to be changed in configuration
   - edit vermont_web.conf
   - call web application by pointing browser to URL http://<server>/<path_to_vermont_web>/start.py
